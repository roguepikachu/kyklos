# Demo Annotations and Captions

**Project:** Kyklos Time Window Scaler
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Owner:** demo-scenario-designer

## Purpose

This document provides consistent text annotations, captions, and overlay language for screenshots, videos, presentations, and documentation. Ensures clear, accurate communication of Kyklos concepts.

---

## Annotation Principles

### Consistency
- Use same terminology across all materials
- Follow Kubernetes conventions (e.g., "replica" not "instance")
- Maintain consistent capitalization (e.g., "TimeWindowScaler" not "Time Window Scaler")

### Clarity
- Keep captions short (< 10 words when possible)
- Use active voice ("Scales to 2 replicas" not "2 replicas are scaled")
- Avoid jargon unless essential (prefer "window" over "time-bounded scheduling interval")

### Accuracy
- All technical terms must match CRD field names
- Timestamps must show timezone (UTC or Europe/Berlin)
- Replica counts must be exact (don't round or approximate)

---

## Standard Terminology

### Core Concepts

**TimeWindowScaler (TWS)**
- Full name: TimeWindowScaler
- Short name: TWS (in CLI contexts)
- NOT: "Time Window Scaler", "time-window-scaler", "Scaler"

**Window States**
- BusinessHours: Active work hours window
- OffHours: Outside any defined windows
- NightShift: Evening/overnight window
- NOT: "business-hours", "off-hours", "night-shift"

**Replica Terminology**
- Current replicas: "2 replicas"
- Scaling action: "Scaling from 0 to 2 replicas"
- Target state: "Desired: 2 replicas"
- NOT: "instances", "pods" (unless specifically referring to Pod resources)

**Time References**
- Always include timezone: "14:38 UTC" or "22:00 CET"
- Use 24-hour format: "14:00" not "2:00 PM"
- Window boundaries: "14:38-14:41 UTC"
- NOT: AM/PM format in technical contexts

---

## Screenshot Annotations

### Annotation Placement

**Do NOT annotate directly on screenshots.** Keep originals clean. Create annotated versions separately.

**Annotation Layers:**
1. Background: Original screenshot
2. Highlight layer: Boxes/circles around important elements
3. Annotation layer: Text labels with arrows
4. Overlay layer: Title/explanation at top or bottom

---

### Visual Annotation Styles

**Highlight Boxes:**
```
Style: 3px solid line
Color: Yellow (#FFD700) or Red (#FF4444) for emphasis
Corner radius: 4px
No fill (transparent background)
```

**Arrows:**
```
Style: 2px solid line with arrowhead
Color: Yellow (#FFD700)
Curve: Slight curve (for aesthetics, not sharp angles)
```

**Text Labels:**
```
Font: Sans-serif (Helvetica, Arial, Roboto)
Size: 24pt for main labels, 18pt for details
Color: White text
Background: Semi-transparent black (#000000 80% opacity)
Padding: 8px around text
Border radius: 4px
```

**Example Annotation Workflow:**
1. Take clean screenshot
2. Open in image editor (Photoshop, Figma, GIMP, or online tool)
3. Add highlight box around element of interest (e.g., WINDOW column)
4. Add arrow pointing from box to empty area
5. Add text label at arrow endpoint
6. Export as PNG with `-annotated` suffix

### Concept Explanations

**What is Kyklos?**
```
Kyklos scales Kubernetes deployments based on time windows

Define business hours ‚Üí Replicas scale automatically
Outside hours ‚Üí Scale to zero ‚Üí Save resources
```

**Time Windows Explained:**
```
Time Window = When + How Many

start: "09:00"  ‚Üê Window opens
end: "17:00"    ‚Üê Window closes
replicas: 5     ‚Üê Desired replica count

timezone: UTC  ‚Üê All times in specified timezone
```

**Default Replicas:**
```
defaultReplicas: 0

Replica count when NO windows match
Typically set to 0 for maximum cost savings
```

**Cross-Midnight Concept:**
```
Cross-Midnight Window:
start > end  ‚Üí  Window spans midnight

Example:
start: "22:00"  (Friday evening)
end: "02:00"    (Saturday morning)

Window active from Fri 22:00 to Sat 02:00
```

---

### Action Captions

**Scale-Up:**
```
Window opened ‚Üí Scaling to 2 replicas
```

```
Scaling from 0 to 2 replicas
```

```
Creating pods...
```

```
Pods running ‚Üí Ready to serve traffic
```

**Scale-Down:**
```
Window closed ‚Üí Scaling to 0 replicas
```

```
Scaling from 2 to 0 replicas
```

```
Terminating pods...
```

```
Back to 0 replicas ‚Üí No resources used
```

**Midnight Transition:**
```
Friday 23:59 ‚Üí Window active, 3 replicas
```

```
Midnight crosses...
```

```
Saturday 00:01 ‚Üí Window STILL active, 3 replicas
Day changed but window continues!
```

```
No scaling at midnight ‚Üí Cross-midnight works correctly
```

---

### Status Captions

**Before Window:**
```
Current: OffHours
Replicas: 0
Status: Waiting for window to open
```

**During Window:**
```
Current: BusinessHours
Replicas: 2
Status: Window active, serving traffic
```

**After Window:**
```
Current: OffHours
Replicas: 0
Status: Window closed, resources reclaimed
```

---

### Educational Captions

**How It Works:**
```
1. Controller watches TimeWindowScalers
2. Evaluates current time vs windows
3. Computes desired replica count
4. Updates target Deployment
5. Schedules next evaluation
```

**Use Cases:**
```
‚úì Business hours scaling (9-5 weekdays)
‚úì Night batch processing (22:00-06:00)
‚úì Weekend capacity reduction
‚úì Timezone-aware global deployments
‚úì Cost optimization via zero-scaling
```

**Benefits:**
```
Predictable scaling based on time
No metrics or thresholds needed
Timezone and DST aware
Works with any Kubernetes cluster
Simple YAML configuration
```

Title: [Project] Kyklos - Time-based autoscaling for Kubernetes

We built Kyklos to solve a simple problem: dev environments running 24/7 when
they're only used 9-5 weekdays.

What it does:
- Scales deployments based on time windows (not metrics)
- Handles cross-midnight windows (e.g., 22:00-02:00)
- Timezone-aware with automatic DST handling
- Can scale to zero outside windows for maximum cost savings

Example use cases:
- Business hours scaling (9 AM - 5 PM ‚Üí N replicas, else 0)
- Night batch jobs (22:00-06:00 ‚Üí N replicas)
- Regional services (scale up during local business hours)

2-minute demo: [link]
GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]

Built using Kubebuilder, follows Kubernetes best practices. Looking for
feedback on the approach and any use cases we might have missed!

## Glossary Annotations

For documentation and tooltips:

**TimeWindowScaler**
```
A Kubernetes custom resource that defines when and how to scale a Deployment
based on time windows.

Example: Scale to 5 replicas during business hours, 0 replicas otherwise.
```

**Window**
```
A time range (start to end) during which a specific replica count is desired.

Windows can cross midnight (e.g., 22:00-02:00) and are timezone-aware.
```

**defaultReplicas**
```
The replica count used when no windows match the current time.

Typically set to 0 for maximum cost savings, or to a minimum viable count for
always-on services.
```

**gracePeriodSeconds**
```
Delay (in seconds) before applying scale-down actions.

Useful for gradual traffic reduction or connection draining.
Scale-up actions are immediate; grace period applies only to scale-down.
```

**Timezone**
```
IANA timezone identifier (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/Berlin").

All window times are interpreted in this timezone. Controller automatically
handles Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions.
```

**Cross-Midnight Window**
```
A window where the end time is earlier than the start time, indicating the
window spans the midnight boundary.

Example: start: "22:00", end: "02:00" means 22:00 today to 02:00 tomorrow.
```
