## Key Decisions Made (BRIEF.md and DECISIONS.md)

### Project Scope
- **Name:** Kyklos (Greek for "cycle")
- **CRD:** TimeWindowScaler (kyklos.io/v1alpha1)
- **Function:** Scale Deployments/StatefulSets/ReplicaSets based on daily time windows
- **V0.1 Limit:** Single time window per resource, daily recurrence only

### Technical Decisions
1. **ADR-0001: Name and Scope**
   - API group: kyklos.io
   - Version: v1alpha1 (alpha signals evolving API)
   - Single window per resource

2. **ADR-0002: Target Kinds and Namespace Model**
   - Supported: Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet
   - Scale via Scale subresource API
   - Cross-namespace support with explicit RBAC

3. **ADR-0003: Timezone and DST Handling**
   - IANA timezone strings (e.g., "Asia/Kolkata")
   - Go time.LoadLocation for DST transitions
   - Wall clock time, not duration arithmetic
   - Cross-midnight windows supported

4. **ADR-0004: Grace Period Semantics**
   - Optional duration field (default: 0)
   - Applies only to scale-down
   - Introduces "GracePeriod" state
   - Maximum: 60 minutes

### Non-Goals for V0.1
- No cron-style syntax or arbitrary expressions
- No calendar integration or holiday awareness
- No multi-day or weekly patterns (beyond daily)
- No autoscaling integration (HPA/VPA)
- No multi-cluster support
- No web UI or dashboard

---

## Glossary Established

18 terms defined in BRIEF.md, used consistently across all documents:
- Active Window, Inactive Window, Grace Period
- DST Transition, Target Workload, IANA Timezone
- Requeue, TimeWindowScaler (TWS), Scale Subresource
- activeReplicas, inactiveReplicas, crossMidnight
- windowStart, windowEnd
- And 5 more specialized terms

All agents must use these terms to ensure clarity and consistency.

## What Changed in BRIEF and DECISIONS

### BRIEF.md
**Initial Version:** 0.1.0
**Changes from Zero:**
- Defined project name (Kyklos) and purpose
- Established goals and non-goals
- Set success criteria (15-minute verifiability)
- Created glossary of 18 terms
- Listed assumptions and constraints

**No Changes Needed:** BRIEF.md is complete and stable for Day 1.

### DECISIONS.md
**Initial Version:** Contains 4 ADRs
**Changes from Zero:**
- ADR-0001: Project name and scope decisions
- ADR-0002: Supported kinds and namespace model
- ADR-0003: Timezone and DST handling approach
- ADR-0004: Grace period semantics (added during planning)

**Open Questions Documented:**
- ADR-0001: Should v0.2 allow multiple windows? If so, precedence rules?
- ADR-0002: Should we support Jobs/CronJobs in future? Need admission webhook for validation?
- ADR-0003: Emit warning metrics on DST dates? Skip DST days option?
- ADR-0004: Grace cancellable if window reactivates? Different grace for different kinds?

These open questions are acknowledged but not blocking v0.1. Will revisit for v0.2.

## Single Biggest Risk and Validation Approach for Day 1

### Biggest Risk: RISK-001 - DST and Cross-Midnight Correctness (Critical)

**Why This is the Biggest Risk:**
- Impacts correctness (core value proposition)
- Complex edge cases (DST spring/fall, cross-midnight)
- Difficult to test (requires mocking time or waiting for actual DST dates)
- High user impact (incorrect scaling breaks trust)
- Pervasive (affects API design, reconcile logic, testing, documentation)

**Day 1 Validation Approach:**

1. **API Design Review (Day 1):**
   - api-crd-designer must include timezone field with clear IANA format requirement
   - Field comments must reference DST handling approach (ADR-0003)
   - Status field must include nextTransitionTime (used to verify DST calculations)

2. **Pre-Work Validation (Day 1 afternoon):**
   - controller-reconcile-designer lists all DST edge cases:
     - Spring-forward: window spanning 2:00 AM on March DST date
     - Fall-back: window spanning 1:00-2:00 AM on November DST date
     - Cross-midnight + DST: window 22:00-02:00 on DST transition night
     - Grace period + DST: grace expires during DST transition
   - Each edge case must have documented expected behavior

3. **Day 2-3 Deep Dive:**
   - controller-reconcile-designer creates decision table in design/reconcile-requeue-logic.md
   - Decision table format:
     ```
     | Scenario | Example Date/Time | Expected State | Next Transition | Rationale |
     |----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
     | DST Spring Forward | 2025-03-09 02:30 | Skip/Previous | ... | ... |
     ```

4. **Day 4 Test Plan:**
   - testing-strategy-designer creates test fixtures with fixed dates:
     - test/fixtures/dst-spring-forward.yaml (2025-03-09)
     - test/fixtures/dst-fall-back.yaml (2025-11-02)
   - Unit tests must cover each scenario from decision table

5. **Continuous Validation:**
   - Every design review asks: "How does this behave during DST transitions?"
   - Every code commit includes DST test cases
   - Gate 3 cannot pass without complete DST decision table

**Success Criteria for Day 1:**
- [ ] Timezone field design accounts for DST (references ADR-0003)
- [ ] controller-reconcile-designer has documented list of all DST edge cases
- [ ] No assumptions made about "time will work itself out" - explicit handling planned

**Escalation Trigger:**
If by end of Day 1 the DST edge case list is incomplete or unclear, escalate immediately to kyklos-orchestrator for extended Day 2 timeline or scope reduction.

## Next Steps (Day 1 Start: 2025-10-20 09:00 IST)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **api-crd-designer:** Read HANDOFFS-DAY1.md Handoff 1, begin CRD schema design
2. **api-validation-defaults-designer:** Read HANDOFFS-DAY1.md Handoff 2, start pre-work (timezone validation research)
3. **controller-reconcile-designer:** Read HANDOFFS-DAY1.md Handoff 3, start pre-work (state machine sketch)
4. **kyklos-orchestrator:** Monitor progress, respond to questions within 2 hours

**Morning Sync (10:00 IST):**
Each agent reports starting status and expected progress

**Midday Check (14:00 IST):**
- api-crd-designer: Status update, ETA for spec completion
- If spec is ready, notify validation and reconcile designers to begin dependencies

**End of Day (18:00 IST):**
- api-crd-designer: Submit Gate 1 for verification
- All agents: Post status updates
- kyklos-orchestrator: Verify Day 1 completion, approve handoffs to Day 2

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Overall Day 0 Completion:** 100%

**Confidence in Day 1 Success:** 85%
- **High Confidence:** API CRD design is well-scoped, single owner, clear requirements
- **Risk:** Field semantics may reveal scope ambiguities (mitigated by BRIEF.md and ADRs)

**Confidence in 14-Day Design Phase:** 80%
- **High Confidence:** Clear roadmap, quality gates, RACI, daily check-ins
- **Risk:** DST correctness may require more time than allocated (mitigated by daily risk review)

**Confidence in v0.1 Achievability:** 75%
- **High Confidence:** Scope is reasonable, success criteria are clear
- **Risk:** Testing time-based behavior may be challenging (mitigated by time mocking strategy)
