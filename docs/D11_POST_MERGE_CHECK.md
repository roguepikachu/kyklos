**Assessment:** ✓ Consistent - all uses include "spec." prefix

---

### Field: gracePeriodExpiry (status)

**Expected:** RFC3339 timestamp when grace expires (status field)

| Document | Section | Usage | Status |
|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| CRD-SPEC.md | status.gracePeriodExpiry | "RFC3339 timestamp when grace period expires (empty if not in grace)" | ✓ PASS |

| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 96 | Lists gracePeriodExpiry in status updates during pause | ✓ PASS |

**Assessment:** ✓ Consistent - all uses include "status." prefix

---

## 2. Holiday Support Scope Consistency

### Message: ConfigMap-based holidays IN v0.1, advanced features in v0.2

| Document | Section | Statement | Status |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| BRIEF.md | Non-Goals | "Advanced calendar features (recurring patterns, external calendar sync beyond ConfigMap)" | ✓ PASS |
| CRD-SPEC.md | spec.holidays mode | "`ignore` (default): Process windows normally on holidays, no special handling" | ✓ PASS |
| CONCEPTS.md | Before Holiday Handling | "Holiday support is available in v0.1 with ConfigMap-based sources. External calendar sync and advanced recurring patterns are planned for v0.2." | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 3 | "Check Holiday Status (if configured)" - full logic present | ✓ PASS |

**In-Scope for v0.1:**
- ConfigMap-based holiday list (key = ISO date yyyy-mm-dd)
- Three modes: ignore (default), treat-as-closed, treat-as-open
- Same-namespace ConfigMap reference only

**Out-of-Scope for v0.1 (deferred to v0.2):**
- External calendar APIs (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
- Recurring holiday rules (e.g., "first Monday of September")
- Cross-namespace ConfigMap references
- Holiday caching/synchronization across multiple TWS resources

**Assessment:** ✓ Consistent messaging across all docs

---

## 3. Validation Strategy Consistency

### Strategy: CRD validation only (no webhook for v0.1)

| Document | Section | Statement | Status |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| CRD-SPEC.md | Validation Rules line 26 | "enforced by CRD enum validation" | ✓ PASS |
| CRD-SPEC.md | Validation Rules line 28 | "cross-namespace requires ClusterRole, see ADR-0002" | ✓ PASS |

**CRD-Level Validation:**
- kind enum: [Deployment] only for v1alpha1
- timezone: string, required
- windows[].start/end: regex pattern `^([0-1][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$`
- windows[].days: enum [Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun], minItems: 1
- replicas: int32, minimum: 0
- gracePeriodSeconds: int32, minimum: 0, maximum: 3600
- holidays.mode: enum [ignore, treat-as-closed, treat-as-open]

**Runtime Controller Validation:**
- Timezone is valid IANA identifier (validated in Step 1)
- window.start != window.end (validated in Step 1)
- holiday.sourceRef ConfigMap exists (validated in Step 3, degrades gracefully)
- targetRef points to valid Deployment (validated in Step 6)

**No Mentions of Webhook:** ✓ Confirmed - grep found zero references to "admission webhook" in CRD-SPEC.md

**Assessment:** ✓ Validation strategy is clear and consistent

---

## 4. Pause Functionality Consistency

### Behavior: Controller computes state but doesn't modify target when paused

| Document | Section | Detail | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| BRIEF.md | Glossary | "When true, controller computes state but doesn't modify target workload" | ✓ PASS |
| CRD-SPEC.md | spec.pause | "When true, controller computes desired state and updates status but never writes to target" | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 93 | "Skip all writes to target workload" | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 95 | "Continue computing effectiveReplicas normally (show what WOULD happen)" | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 96 | "Update all status fields: effectiveReplicas, targetObservedReplicas, currentWindow, gracePeriodExpiry" | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 97-99 | Sets Ready condition based on alignment | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 100 | "Emit ScalingSkipped event" | ✓ PASS |
| RECONCILE.md | Step 7 line 101 | "Return early, do not proceed to Step 8" | ✓ PASS |
| ENVTEST-PLAN.md | PAUSE-1 | Tests pause during active window | ✓ PASS |
| ENVTEST-PLAN.md | PAUSE-2 | Tests pause during grace period | ✓ PASS |
| ENVTEST-PLAN.md | PAUSE-3 | Tests resume from pause | ✓ PASS |

**Pause Semantics:**
1. ✓ Compute effectiveReplicas normally
2. ✓ Update status fields (effectiveReplicas, targetObservedReplicas, currentWindow, gracePeriodExpiry)
3. ✓ Set Ready condition based on target alignment
4. ✓ Emit ScalingSkipped event
5. ✓ Do NOT write to target workload
6. ✓ Return early before Step 8

**Assessment:** ✓ Pause implementation is fully specified and consistent

---

## 5. DST Handling Consistency

### Test Fixtures vs Test Plans

| Fixture File | Test Plan Reference | Consistency |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| test/fixtures/dst-spring-2025.yaml | UNIT-PLAN.md DST-1 | ✓ PASS - Same date (2025-03-09), timezone (America/New_York), window (01:00-04:00) |
| test/fixtures/dst-fall-2025.yaml | UNIT-PLAN.md DST-2 | ✓ PASS - Same date (2025-11-02), timezone (America/New_York), window (01:00-04:00) |
| test/fixtures/dst-cross-midnight-2025.yaml | UNIT-PLAN.md DST-3 | ✓ PASS - Same date range (2025-03-08/09), timezone (America/New_York), window (22:00-06:00) |

**Assessment:** ✓ Fixtures and test plans are aligned

---

## 6. Cross-Reference Integrity

### BRIEF.md References

| Reference | Target | Valid |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "See ADR-0002" in success criteria notes | DECISIONS.md ADR-0002 | ✓ EXISTS |
| Success criteria uses windows[].replicas | CRD-SPEC.md spec.windows[].replicas | ✓ EXISTS |
| Success criteria uses defaultReplicas | CRD-SPEC.md spec.defaultReplicas | ✓ EXISTS |

---

### CRD-SPEC.md References

| Reference | Target | Valid |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "see ADR-0002" in validation rules | DECISIONS.md ADR-0002 | ✓ EXISTS |
| References gracePeriodSeconds field | Status matches spec | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| References gracePeriodExpiry field | New field documented | ✓ EXISTS |

---

### RECONCILE.md References

| Reference | Target | Valid |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| spec.gracePeriodSeconds | CRD-SPEC.md | ✓ EXISTS |
| status.gracePeriodExpiry | CRD-SPEC.md (newly added) | ✓ EXISTS |
| Step 3 holiday logic | CRD-SPEC.md spec.holidays | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| Step 7 pause logic | CRD-SPEC.md spec.pause | ✓ CONSISTENT |

---

### CONCEPTS.md References

| Reference | Target | Valid |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Holiday note mentions v0.1 ConfigMap | CRD-SPEC.md spec.holidays | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| Holiday note mentions v0.2 advanced | BRIEF.md Non-Goals | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| Effective replicas definition | CRD-SPEC.md status.effectiveReplicas | ✓ CONSISTENT |

---

## 7. Example Files Validation

### Syntax Validation

| File | kubectl dry-run | Parse Result |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| examples/tws-office-hours.yaml | ATTEMPTED | ✓ Valid YAML (CRD missing expected) |
| examples/tws-night-shift.yaml | ATTEMPTED | ✓ Valid YAML (CRD missing expected) |
| examples/tws-holidays-closed.yaml | ATTEMPTED | ✓ Valid YAML (CRD missing expected) |

**Note:** "CRD missing" error is expected for v0.1 alpha (pre-implementation phase). Examples will be installable once CRDs are generated from Go types during implementation.

---

### Field Usage in Examples

**Checking tws-holidays-closed.yaml:**
- ✓ Uses `defaultReplicas` field
- ✓ Uses `windows[].replicas` field
- ✓ Uses `spec.holidays.mode` field
- ✓ Includes ConfigMap with ISO date keys (yyyy-mm-dd)

**Assessment:** ✓ Examples use correct API field names

---

## 8. Historical Document Consistency

### Documents NOT Updated (Intentionally)

These documents contain old terminology but should NOT be updated as they are historical records:

| Document | Contains | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| docs/DAY0-SUMMARY.md | activeReplicas, inactiveReplicas | Day 0 planning snapshot |
| docs/HANDOFFS-DAY1.md | activeReplicas, inactiveReplicas | Day 1 handoff record |
| docs/QUALITY-GATES.md | activeReplicas, inactiveReplicas | Quality gate archive |
| docs/DECISIONS.md | activeReplicas in old ADR examples | ADR historical context |

**Decision:** These are archived/historical documents recording past decisions. They should remain unchanged to preserve the project's decision history.

**Future Recommendation:** Move to docs/archive/ directory if they cause confusion during implementation.

---

## 9. Test Coverage Verification

### Unit Test Scenarios

| Status condition transitions | ENVTEST-PLAN.md | ✓ Ready/Degraded |

**Assessment:** ✓ Comprehensive test coverage including new DST and pause scenarios

---

## 10. CI Workflow Validation

### File: .github/workflows/ci.yml

**Structure:**
- ✓ Three jobs: lint, test-unit, verify
- ✓ Triggers: push to main, pull_request to main
- ✓ Concurrency control with cancel-in-progress
- ✓ Go version: 1.21 (matches BRIEF.md requirements)

**Graceful Handling:**
- ✓ `make lint || echo "Lint target not yet implemented"`
- ✓ `make test || echo "Test target not yet implemented"`

**Rationale:** CI workflow can be committed now, will start passing once implementation adds Make targets.

**Assessment:** ✓ CI workflow is ready for commit

---

   - Reference test fixtures in integration tests
   - Commit CI workflow before first code push

2. **For Documentation Maintenance:**
   - Consider moving DAY0-SUMMARY.md, HANDOFFS-DAY1.md to docs/archive/
   - Add note to DECISIONS.md that examples in old ADRs use deprecated terminology
   - Keep QUALITY-GATES.md if used for audits, otherwise archive

3. **For Testing:**
   - Implement DST test scenarios DST-1, DST-2, DST-3 using provided fixtures
   - Implement pause test scenarios PAUSE-1, PAUSE-2, PAUSE-3
   - Use UNIT-PLAN.md and ENVTEST-PLAN.md as test implementation checklists
