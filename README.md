# Kyklos Time Window Scaler

Kyklos is a Kubernetes operator that automatically scales Deployments based on time windows, enabling you to align resource consumption with actual usage patternsâ€”scaling up during business hours and down during off-peak times.

Unlike cron-based scaling (manual triggers) or HPA (metric-based), Kyklos scales proactively based on predictable time patterns. Perfect for business hours traffic, batch processing windows, or any workload with time-based demand.

## Why Kyklos?

- **Time-aware scaling** - Scale up before peak hours, down after
- **Calendar integration** - Handle holidays and special dates automatically
- **Timezone support** - Full DST handling with IANA timezones
- **Graceful downscaling** - Optional delay when reducing replicas
- **Drift correction** - Automatically reverts manual scaling changes
- **Declarative configuration** - Single resource instead of multiple cron jobs
- **Overlapping windows** - Handle complex schedules with automatic precedence
- **Production-ready** - Status conditions, events, and metrics built-in

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

Get Kyklos running on a fresh Kind cluster in under 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.0+
- Docker 17.03+
- kubectl 1.25.0+
- Kind or k3d installed
- Access to a Kubernetes 1.25.0+ cluster

Verify prerequisites:
```bash
make verify-tools
```

### Installation

1. **Create local cluster** (if using Kind)
```bash
make cluster-up
```

2. **Build and push your image**
```bash
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kyklos:tag
```

Or for local development with Kind:
```bash
make build docker-build kind-load
```

3. **Install CRDs and deploy controller**
```bash
make install
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kyklos:tag
```

Or for local development:
```bash
make install-crds deploy
```

4. **Verify controller is running**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyklos-system
```

Expected output:
```
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kyklos-controller-manager-abc123-xyz      1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Your First TimeWindowScaler

Create a deployment and scale it based on office hours:

```bash
# Create demo namespace and target deployment (optional)
make demo-setup
```

Apply this TimeWindowScaler:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyklos.kyklos.io/v1alpha1
kind: TimeWindowScaler
metadata:
  name: business-hours-scaler
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  timezone: "America/New_York"
  defaultReplicas: 2
  windows:
  # Scale to 10 replicas during business hours
  - name: BusinessHours
    start: "09:00"
    end: "17:00"
    replicas: 10
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
  # Scale to 20 replicas during lunch peak
  - name: LunchPeak
    start: "12:00"
    end: "14:00"
    replicas: 20
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

Save as `office-hours.yaml` and apply:
```bash
kubectl apply -f office-hours.yaml
```

Watch it work:
```bash
kubectl get tws -w
# Or with more details
kubectl get tws,deploy,pods -n demo
```

For a fast 10-minute demo with minute-scale windows:
```bash
make demo-apply-minute
make demo-watch
```

### Next Steps

- **[Concepts](docs/user/CONCEPTS.md)** - Understand windows, boundaries, and holidays
- **[Operations Guide](docs/user/OPERATIONS.md)** - Run Kyklos in production
- **[FAQ](docs/user/FAQ.md)** - Common questions answered
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/user/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Fix common issues
- **[API Reference](docs/api/CRD-SPEC.md)** - Complete CRD specification

## Features

- **Time-based scaling**: Define windows with start/end times and replica counts
- **Timezone aware**: Handles any IANA timezone with automatic DST adjustments
- **Holiday support**: Scale differently on holidays via ConfigMap (closed, open, ignore modes)
- **Overlapping windows**: Last window wins for precedence control
- **Grace periods**: Delayed scale-down to avoid flapping
- **Pause mode**: Temporarily disable scaling while keeping configuration
- **Cross-midnight windows**: Seamlessly handle windows that span days
- **Manual drift correction**: Automatically reverts manual scaling changes
- **Status tracking**: Comprehensive conditions and events for observability

## Examples

See the [examples/](examples/) directory:
- `tws-office-hours.yaml` - Business hours scaling pattern
- `tws-night-shift.yaml` - Cross-midnight window example
- `tws-holidays-closed.yaml` - Holiday handling example

Example configurations:

```yaml
# Cross-midnight window
apiVersion: kyklos.kyklos.io/v1alpha1
kind: TimeWindowScaler
metadata:
  name: night-shift-scaler
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    name: batch-processor
  timezone: "UTC"
  defaultReplicas: 2
  windows:
  - name: NightShift
    start: "22:00"
    end: "06:00"
    replicas: 20
    days: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

## Project Status

**Current Implementation Status**:
- âœ… Core time window engine (83.8% test coverage)
- âœ… Basic controller with scaling logic
- âœ… Status updates and events
- âœ… Pause mode
- âœ… Holiday modes (via ConfigMap)
- âœ… Cross-midnight windows
- âœ… DST handling
